An application that uses M5Cardputer to interact with the Gemini API for generating responses based on user input. This project includes code for managing Wi-Fi connectivity, handling user input, making API requests, and displaying responses on the M5Cardputer's screen.

## Features

- **User Input Handling**: Accepts user input through the M5Cardputer keyboard.
- **API Integration**: Sends queries to the Gemini API and processes the responses.
- **Display Management**: Manages the display of user input and responses.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Connects to the specified Wi-Fi network for API communication.
- **Configuration**: Reads configuration data such as Wi-Fi credentials and API key from an SD card.
